This project includes the bones of a little glossary app. It's being built to power a glossary of sailing terms.  It's built in javascript using: 
* nodejs
* express
* mongo
* mongoose


To use it:

1. install node on your machine (go here: http://nodejs.org/)
1. install mongo on your machine (go here: http://www.mongodb.org/)
1. clone this repository
1. run 'npm install'
1. start mongo
1. run 'grunt nodemon', this runs the app in dev mode, restarting when it detects a file change. 


Enjoy!
